bootstrap social-links disabled
To disable social links in Bootstrap, you can remove the corresponding HTML code for the links or use CSS to hide them. For example, you can add the following CSS to your stylesheet to hide the social links:

css
Copy code
.social-links {
    display: none;
}
Alternatively, you can add the "disabled" class to the parent element of the social links to achieve the same result:

php
Copy code
<div class="social-links disabled">
    <!-- Social links go here -->
</div>

.disabled {
    display: none;
}

i want to show it but in grey like disabled
To show the social links as disabled in Bootstrap, you can add a custom CSS class to change the color of the links. For example, you can add the following CSS to your stylesheet:

css
Copy code
.social-links a {
    color: #ccc;
    pointer-events: none;
}
This CSS will change the color of the social links to a light grey (#ccc) and make them non-clickable by disabling pointer events. The links will be visible but appear as if they are disabled.
